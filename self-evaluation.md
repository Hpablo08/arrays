## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
> I feel so so. I under stand the content and how arrays work and what they're used for. As with everything I've learned so for I would like more hands on practice.


## Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
> I want to understand booleans more. I'd like a physical lesson on them so I will probably search for videos regarding them for more explanation.

## What questions do you have about Arrays?
>Nothing that I can think of right now. I'm just letting all soak in still.
